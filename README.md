# Building the FizzBuzz
###Eloquent Javascript Ch. 2

I started with a basic for loop counting up to and equal to 100
Next I began an if/else statement starting with the FizzBuzz search
 - If the numbers with divisible by 3 as well as 5 it is set to print FizzBuzz
 - The next if statement looks for numbers that are only divisibly by 3 and prints out "Fizz"
 - In the last if statement the program is looking for any number divisible by 5 and will print out "Buzz"
 - Lastly and numbers that do not fall under one of the above specifications will just print out the given number
